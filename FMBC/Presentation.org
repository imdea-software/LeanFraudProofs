* Introduction
+ WHAT ::
  A simple /Lean/ mechanization of Fraud-Proof games.
+ WHY ::
  Provide basic building blocks to prove that /honest players/ always win and
  guarantee correctness of /Optimistic Rollups/ Layer-2 schemes.
+ HOW ::
  We focus on the structure of arguments using /authenticated data-structures/
  (Merkle trees.)

#+BEGIN_NOTES
+ WHAT :: this is about a lean library we programmed to do stuff
+ WHY :: I actually serves to several thing. First, optimistic rollups based
  their correctness in that a single /honest/ player can guarantee correctness
  of the whole ecosystem.
+ HOW :: ??
#+END_NOTES

** Layer-2
+ Problem :: Scalability.
+ Solution :: Take everything outside the blockchain.
+ Constrain :: Keep the same guarantees as the blockchain.

** Optimistic Rollups -- RDoC

+ Instead of computing, results are assumed correct unless someone challenge the
claim.
+ There is a time period where challengers can challenge
+ If a claim is challenged, the proposer and the challenger of the claim engage
  into a two-player game.
+ In the blockchain, only the claim and the arbitration of the games are recorded.

** TODO Explain Optimistic Rollups
** TODO Diff between Arbitrum and RDoC?

* Implicit Game Arenas

Instead of playing games exploring /implicit trees/, we made them explicit.
We define the arena of arbitration games as trees.

We can state explicitly what properties our system has to prove and maintain.

* Winning Conditions

Our expressions are define as folds/traversals, so to win a game, players must
win it in all possible states.
In our case, at the leaf level and node level.

* Formal Statements Decomposition

Moving from arbitration over traces to clever game decomposition into simpler
games.

* Closing Remarks

+ This was fun, but a lot of work. Can we build a systems handling as much as boiler-plate possible?
+ Can we find other games to decompose them in a clever way?
+ Domain specific Layer-2 schemes Language (Frugal?)
